# WaveShare UGV Autonomous Robot (ESP32 + Raspberry Pi 5)

This repository contains the software stack for an **autonomous WaveShare UGV Tracked Robot**, combining a **real-time ESP-based microcontroller** with a **Raspberry Pi 5** for high-level control, AI vision, and autonomy.

The goal of this project is to explore **autonomous navigation**, **computer vision**, and **edge AI**, using affordable off-the-shelf hardware.

## 🚀 Project Goals

This is a learning project.

- Autonomous driving of a tracked UGV platform
- AI-based vision (object detection, tracking, lane/path following)
- Clear separation between **real-time motor control** and **high-level intelligence**
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Open and reproducible experimentation platform
